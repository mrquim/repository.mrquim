1.1.4q by [COLOR FF8ABEE2]Open[/COLOR][COLOR FF757677]ELEQ[/COLOR]
- Expanded Custom (playlist) from 4 to 36
- Added "addArtistChannel"-mode which will search based on name-argument and display results to chose from before making your chosen artist into a channel, 
  adding your chosen artist to that channel, converting all musicvideos of that artist into .strm-files and placing them in 
  ~/profile/addon_data/plugin.video.vevo_tv/library/artist, triggering a library update for folder ~/profile/addon_data/plugin.video.vevo_tv/library/artist 
  and finally playing that (shuffled) channel.
