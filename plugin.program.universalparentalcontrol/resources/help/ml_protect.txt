Universal Parental Control does a pretty good job of restricting what can be viewed, but it can be disabled or 
even removed if someone knows their way around Kodi. To protect the installation of this addon it is a good idea to set a Master Lock password and lock certain ares of the Kodi interface. 

[COLOR gold][B]Set a Password and lock sections of Kodi[/B][/COLOR] 

1. Select System/Settings/System/Master Lock.
2. Select Master Lock code and settings
3. On the next window select [Master Lock] and choose a password type. You will be prompted to enter and then confirm your new password.
4. Enable "Lock programs and script winddows" and "Lock Addon Manager" then hit ok.

This means you will be asked for a password when trying to view the Programs section or Settings/Addons. It's not completely secure, but should stop the addon being disabled via the GUI.
